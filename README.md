# About the Project

This project was carried out in conjunction with the classes available in the course ***"COMPLETE Java 2023 Object-Oriented Programming + Projects"*** on the platfform [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).

In short, the development was done with the **Spring Boot** framework, in witch I had contact for the first time with in-depth use of an **API** that allows connection of java programs with a database, in the case of **JDBC** (Java Database Connectivity) and implementation **DAO** (Data Access Object) standard, involving a basic **sales** and **department system**. 

## Project Structure 
- **Layered architecture - MVC**
- Design Pattern: **DAO** (Data Access Object)

## Backend
- **Java**
- **Spring Boot** 
- **JPA** + **Hibernate** implementation (data access with Object-relational mapping - **ORM**)
- **Maven** (dependency management)
  
## Connection to the Database
- **JDBC** (SQL-based data access)
  
## Web Requests
- **Postman** (testing requests with methods GET, PUT, POST e DELETE)
- **Thunder Client** (extension for testing requests in vscode)
